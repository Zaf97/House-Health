# House-Health
 House Health is an application, powered by Arduino, Microsoft Visual Studio, Windows 10 and Microsoft Azure, which collect data from a various of sensors, like air quality sensors, light sensors, motion sensors and temperature sensors, process that data and give some results. The data storage with the help of Arduino MKR1000 board in an SQL database on Azure and then with some data from msn weather and a process with Azures Machine learning give to user a complete knowledge of the air condition in his house and much more. The results come to user throw a UWP application so he can check it via his windows phone, desktop, tablet or even his Microsoft band. The application also uses the Band SDK to collect data from Microsoft Health and use it to provide more and better results from Machine Learning. Now, the results are the houses air condition, but also, the time and the duration that the windows should be opened each day (e.g. depended on if it’s a work day, weekend or a trip day), the right temperature of the house according to user’s body temperature and situation (e.g. if user sleeps or not, if he is sick or sweat).
